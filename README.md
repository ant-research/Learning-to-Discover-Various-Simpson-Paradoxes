# Learning to Discover Various Simpson’s Paradoxes

This repository includes the implementation details of the method ```SimNet``` and helps readers to reproduce the results in the paper **Learning to Discover Various Simpson’s Paradoxes**（KDD 2023）.

SimNet is a simple neural network model with high operational efficiency. 

```KDD2023_SimNet_Full.pdf``` is the complete version of our paper, including all experimental results.


## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.13.0
- pandas	1.5.1
- scipy	1.9.3
- numpy	1.23.4
- statsmodels	0.13.5

## Datasets
The repository includes:
- Altanla city employee salary (CES) data
- Auto mile per gallon (MPG) data
- UC Berkeley admission data
- Titanic data
- Synthetic data of different noise levels mentioned in our paper.

## Methods
The repository includes three methods to discover Simpson's paradox. Methods can be chosen when one creates an object of SimpsonParadoxFinder.
- ```naive```: An implementation of the simple method from paper "*Detecting Simpson’s Paradox*" (FLAIRS 2018).
- ```trend```: An implementation of the ```Trend Simpson's Paradox Algorithm``` from paper "*Can you Trust the Trend?: Discovering Simpson's Paradoxes in Social Data*" (WSDM 2018).
- ```simnet```: The one proposed in our paper (KDD 2023).

## Hyper-parameter Usage of SimNet
- ```hidden_dim```: the dimension of hidden layers, set large (e.g. 256) when the number of features is large.
- ```learning_rate```: set small (e.g. 0.001) when the number of samples is large.
- ```find_strong_amp```: set ```True``` if expect to discover 'AMP2' when $PCC_{T,Y}>0$ or to discover 'AMP1' when $PCC_{T,Y}<0$.

## Quick Start
An example for Simpson's paradox discovery using SimNet on Iris data.

```python
python run_iris.py
```
